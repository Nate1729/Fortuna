# Fortuna
This repository is for all things game related. [Fortuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortuna)
is the Roman god of fortune. I am a full stack developer and I have a passion for card games.
But remembering all the rules for each game is tedious and I always have to look different
places for each game. My current plans are just to make a simple user interface for keeping
track of score.
